This is a CrossFit app where you can learn workout moves through video links and keep track from your personal records

I was wondering if I should handle apps database online but decided to keep it offline. 

I also tried to clean up and delete some of the code but instead I guess I messed up the code, since it's been a while since I last touched the code...
